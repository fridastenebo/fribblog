Fiddled with adding a theme today. Of course I underestimated and thought it would be super quick,
but of course not.

- [x] Find a theme - _minimal_
- [x] Figure out colors and applying them to all relevant classes
- [x] Learn how to deal with image links that won't break
- [ ] Modify some of the theme layouts
